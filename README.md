# AutoVulnScan
Automated Vulnerability Scanner Bot in Bash, ideal for penetration testing. It supports custom target IP/hostname, port range scanning with Nmap, and web vulnerability checks with Nikto. Results are saved locally, with an optional S3 upload for cloud use, making it versatile for local or AWS environments.
